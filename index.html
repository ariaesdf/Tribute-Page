	<h3>A Young Beginning</h3>
	<p> <b>Ham Jang-sik</b> started playing video games at just 7 years old with Starcraft: Brood Wars. He began playing well after the game was competitively popular. Unfortunately for Lustboy this meant there wasn't much room for innovation. In his own words 
	"I really like to make innovation...I like trying new things no one's ever tried before. But [Blizzard] already made SC1 a long time ago so there [wasn't much for me to do]." He later played Starcraft II at the Semi-Pro level joining Korean Team Prime as a substitute in 2010. The following year he began playing League of Legends.</p>
